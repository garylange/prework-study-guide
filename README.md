# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This studyguide was created to address two problems:
1. Provide Bootcamp students with a resource for information on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, etc.
2. Provide the clueless, head-scratching author of this studyguide with practice in using those web technologies.

In creating this studyguide, I learned that when working with these technologies, if you can manage to replace "panic" with "stubborn", it helps a lot.

The Prework Study Guide is divided in to sections, with each section containing notes on a specific topic (HTML, CSS, etc.). If you're not sure where to start, you can open the DevTools console in your browser, where you will see a list of topics and a (random) suggestion of a topic to study first.
